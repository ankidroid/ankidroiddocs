== Version 0.1 to 1.1.3 
AnkiDroid has continuously evolved collectively as an open source project, with the first version released to the Google Market on http://nicolas-raoul.blogspot.jp/2009/06/just-published-ankidroid-on-market.html[June 28 2009]. 
Version 1.1.3 was the last 1.x version (released on 26th June 2012), before the incompatible AnkiDroid v2.0 was released, 
essentially rewritten from scratch to be compatible with the new Anki Desktop v2.0.
