<div class="paragraph"><p>Thank you for using AnkiDroid, the Android client for the popular
<a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> spaced repetition system.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anki is spaced repetition technique which is simple but highly effective. It helps you memorize things by automatically repeating them across increasing intervals based on your responses with no need for you to keep track of what to study or when to study it. You create notes (or download shared decks) with content you need to memorize, and the scheduler will make sure you see the content when you need to.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>AnkiDroid is intended to be used in conjunction with Anki on your computer. While it is possible to function without it,
some tasks are either only possible with, or a lot more efficient with Anki Desktop. Furthermore, it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> to at least read <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/getting-started?id=key-concepts">"Key Concepts"</a> section of the main Anki manual to understand the terminology used here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If this manual doesn&#8217;t contain what you are looking for, please check the <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki">AnkiDroid Wiki</a> for a list of changes, instructions for submitting bug reports and feature requests, a list of frequently asked questions, and much more.</p></div>

<h2 id="editingNotes">Edit Note Screen</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The edit note screen can be opened by choosing edit while reviewing, or by opening a card in the browser.
The edit screen is similar to the add new note screen mentioned above, with some key
differences:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Changing the deck operates on the selected card (which is underlined in the "Cards" box).
 If a note type is chosen which has more than one card, only the currently selected card will be moved to the new deck.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Changing the "Type" dropdown selector changes to the note type edit mode. In this mode, editing the content of the note (i.e. deck, fields, etc) is disabled,
 and if a custom note type with more than two fields is being used, additional buttons will appear which let you control the mapping of the fields to the new note type.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If a note type is selected which has less cards than the original note type, only the first n cards will be kept. For example changing from "Basic (and reversed card)" to "Basic"
 will lead to only the first card being kept. To warn you of this, the text in the "Cards" box will appear red, and a confirmation dialog will be shown before the note is saved.</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>Hint: to change the type for multiple notes in one go, or to customize the mapping between cards, use the "Change note type" option in the browser on Anki Desktop.</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The browser screen starts by displaying all the cards in the currently selected deck.  You can search for cards in the selected deck
by tapping the magnifying glass icon in the top. You can change the selected deck (or change to all decks) by choosing the deck from the
dropdown list on the top left.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By default, the first column in the browser gives the text which will be shown on the question (i.e. front side) of the flashcard, and the second column shows the text from the answer (i.e. the back side) of the flashcard.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first column can also be configured to show the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/editing?id=customizing-fields">"sort field"</a> for a more compact display. The second column can be configured

<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the content of the columns is dynamically calculated as your scroll through the list of the cards.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>From the search results, you can tap on a card to edit it (see the <a href="#editingNotes">edit note section</a> above), or long-tapping on it will show a menu allowing you to
perform the following actions:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Mark / unmark note 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Add / remove the "marked" tag from the note. Cards with a marked note are highlighted in purple.

Delete the note of the currently selected card, and all cards belonging to that note.
This action cannot be undone without <a href="#backups">restoring from backup</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">

Render the currently selected card so that you can see what it looks like in the reviewer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">

</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Long-tapping on a single card will select the single card. While that card is selected, if you long-tap on another card on your screen, then all of the cards between the first selected card and the long-tapped card will be selected. This allows for actions to be performed on multiple cards at once, as demonstrated below.

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="filtered">Filtered Decks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anki is designed to optimize the learning process, so that you study the
minimum amount necessary to remember the majority of your cards. Once the
congratulations screen is reached, further study becomes a case of diminishing
returns: the amount of extra time spent going over the same cards again is
generally not worth the moderate increase in retention you&#8217;ll see.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That said, if you have a test looming, or simply want to pass some time, it&#8217;s
possible to keep reviewing even after you are shown the congratulations message.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A <em>filtered deck</em> is a temporary deck that contains cards based on various
criteria, such as "forgotten today", "is tagged <em>hard</em>", and so on. After
studying cards in a filtered deck, or when the filtered deck is deleted, the
cards are automatically returned to their original deck.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The easiest way to create a filtered deck is by long clicking on a deck and choosing the "custom study" option.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Advanced users can create a filtered deck manually, by choosing "Create filtered deck" from the overflow menu in the deck list screen.</p></div>

<h3 id="_editing_fields_as_rtl">Editing Fields as RTL</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Fields can be marked as RTL (currently possible only from Anki Desktop) for RTL editing. When a field is marked as RTL, then the text is right-aligned in editing fields and punctuation is correctly displayed at the end (left) of sentences. Text that contains blocks of LTR characters will be properly displayed as well, with the beginning of the sentence appearing to the right of the LTR block and the end of the sentence being displayed to the left of the LTR block.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Directionality is especially important for editing and creating RTL cloze deletions as the cloze format includes both neutral and LTR markup characters. Therefore it is recommended to use a separate note type for LTR cloze deletions and RTL cloze deletions.</p></div>

<h2 id="AnkiDesktop">Using Anki Desktop with AnkiDroid</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anki has a free cloud synchronization service called AnkiWeb that makes it
easy to keep your card decks in sync between mobile devices and your computer.
If you cannot use sync for some reason, it&#8217;s also possible to use USB, though this method is more laborious.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that AnkiDroid is not affiliated with Anki Desktop or AnkiWeb. AnkiDroid is based on Anki Desktop but it is developed by an entirely separate community of volunteers.</p></div>
<img src="img/AnkiDesktop.png">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_via_cloud_sync">Via Cloud Sync</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before you can use AnkiWeb, you&#8217;ll first need to create an account by visiting <a href="https://ankiweb.net">https://ankiweb.net</a> and clicking the <strong>Sign Up</strong> button. If you have used AnkiWeb in the past, you can skip this step. After signing up, see the corresponding instructions below, depending on whether you are trying to get your existing decks into AnkiDroid or out of AnkiDroid.</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sync_existing_decks_into_a_new_ankidroid_install">Sync existing decks into a new AnkiDroid install</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this scenario you have some existing Anki decks that you want to copy into a new install of AnkiDroid by syncing with AnkiWeb. Open the Anki client with your existing decks (usually this would be Anki desktop, but it could also mean a version of AnkiDroid you have been using on another device), and click the synchronization button (which has two arrows in a circle) at the top right of the deck list.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you have never used AnkiWeb before you will need to enter your credentials if prompted, and
then press the "Upload to AnkiWeb" button to confirm overwriting the empty collection on AnkiWeb with your existing decks in Anki. Anki will upload all your cards, images and audio to AnkiWeb. If you have a lot of media, this may take some time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the synchronization has completed, open AnkiDroid in the device that you are trying to copy the existing decks into, and tap the <strong>Sync</strong> button in the app bar at the top of the main <a href="#deckPicker">deck list</a>.
After entering your AnkiWeb credentials, AnkiDroid will download all your cards and media, and remember your login information for next time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that if you have any existing material in AnkiDroid before attempting to sync, you may be shown a message
asking you to choose to either download from AnkiWeb, or upload to AnkiWeb. If you are happy to lose the cards
in AnkiDroid then simply choose <strong>Download</strong>. If you need to merge the existing cards with AnkiDroid then you should see the
<a href="#AnkiWebConflicts">resolving conflicts</a> section before continuing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After the first synchronization has completed, you can click the sync button
again any time you wish to synchronize your changes to the cloud. Only changes
made since the previous sync will be sent, so subsequent syncs are a lot
faster.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you add some new cards on the desktop computer and want to sync them to
AnkiDroid, you&#8217;d repeat the same basic process: sync on desktop (or close the
program, as it syncs automatically on close by default), and then tap the sync
button on AnkiDroid.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sync_from_ankidroid_to_computer">Sync from AnkiDroid to Computer</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The process of syncing from AnkiDroid to computer is essentially the same as syncing from computer to
AnkiDroid, but in reverse.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>From the <a href="#deckPicker">deck list</a>, tap the sync button in the top right (it has two arrows
in a circle). If it&#8217;s your first time using AnkiWeb, you may need to
enter your login credentials, and then press the "upload" button to upload your AnkiDroid collection
to AnkiWeb.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the synchronization has completed, open Anki Desktop on your computer and press the sync button there
(with two arrows in a circle), and Anki will download your collection.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="AnkiWebConflicts">Dealing with merge conflicts on AnkiWeb</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Although it should not happen often, occasionally you may end up in the position where your cards on AnkiDroid can
not be automatically merged with the cards on AnkiWeb. In this case it&#8217;s necessary to choose to either upload to or download from
AnkiWeb, which would overwrite any changes on the other side.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you have new cards on both sides which you want to keep,
before syncing you can <a href="#exporting">export a deck package</a> for each deck containing new cards from AnkiDroid, then when you do the sync
choose "download" to download from AnkiWeb. After the synchronization has completed, you can import the decks you previously exported from AnkiDroid,
as per the <a href="#importing">importing section</a>.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_via_usb">Via USB</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you don&#8217;t have regular internet access, it&#8217;s still possible to copy decks
back and forth to your device, by using USB.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The USB method works by importing or exporting all your decks at once.
This means that unlike syncing via AnkiWeb, you can&#8217;t make changes from
two locations at once and then merge them. Instead, if you wish to add cards
on the desktop, you need to make sure you export the latest version of your
collection from your mobile device first, or you&#8217;ll end up losing any reviews
done on the mobile device.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thus the workflow you would typically use is to export your collection from
your mobile device and import it into the desktop, make modifications on the
desktop, and then export your collection and import it back into your mobile
device.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>AnkiDroid can&#8217;t directly import text files. If you wish to do that, you&#8217;ll
need to do that with the desktop program, and then import your collection into
AnkiDroid.</p></div>

AnkiWeb account

<p>
Change the account used for syncing with the cloud. For more information on syncing, please see <a href="#AnkiDesktop">this section</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Fetch media on sync
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
By default, AnkiDroid will sync sounds and images as well as your cards and review history.
 If you disable this option, sounds and images will not be downloaded from or uploaded to the sync server by AnkiDroid.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Automatic synchronization
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Enable this option if you want AnkiDroid to sync every time you open and close the app. There is a limit of once every ten minutes for this behavior. Once a sync begins you can cancel it by pressing your device&#8217;s back button, however it can take some time for the cancellation to take effect.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>+
Users that want more fine-grained control over when sync occurred might like to use a 3rd party app like Tasker to automate synchronization. See the <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/AnkiDroid-API#sync-intent">API documentation</a> for more information on this.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Deck for new cards
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The default of "Use current deck" means that Anki saves the last-used note type for each deck
and selects it again then next time you choose the deck (and, in addition, will start with the current deck selected when choosing
Add from anywhere). The other option, "Decide by note type," saves the last-used deck for each note type
(and opens the add window to the last-used note type when you choose Add). This may be more convenient if you always use a single note
type for each deck.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Language
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Change the language. Note: AnkiDroid translations are contributed by volunteers. If you find missing or incorrect translations,
feel free to contribute to the translation project. More details can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Contributing#translate-ankidroid">AnkiDroid Wiki</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Error reporting mode

<h3 id="_reviewing">Reviewing</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The reviewing screen allows you to customize how AnkiDroid behaves when you&#8217;re
reviewing cards. Note that only the reviewing settings which are applied to <strong>all decks</strong> are shown here. There are more settings related
to reviewing which are <strong>deck specific</strong>. These deck specific settings are located in <strong>Deck options</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>

Controls when new cards are shown: either mixed with, after, or before all reviews.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Start of next day 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Controls when AnkiDroid should start showing the next day&#8217;s cards.
The default setting of 4AM ensures that if you&#8217;re studying around midnight, you won&#8217;t have two days worth of cards shown to you in one
session. If you stay up very late or wake up very early, you may want to adjust this to a time you&#8217;re usually sleeping.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Learn ahead limit 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The Learn ahead limit tells AnkiDroid how to behave when there is nothing left to study in the current deck
but cards in learning. The default setting of 20 minutes tells AnkiDroid that cards should be shown early if they are due to be shown in
less than 20 minutes and there&#8217;s nothing else to do. If you set this to 0, Anki will always wait the full period, showing the congratulations
screen until the remaining cards are ready to be reviewed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Timebox limit
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Timeboxing is a technique to help you focus by dividing a longer activity (such as a 30 minute study session) into smaller
blocks. If you set the timebox time limit to a non-zero number of minutes, AnkiDroid will periodically show a message saying you how many
cards you&#8217;ve managed to study during the prescribed time limit.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="mathjax">MathJax Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Mathjax is a modern typesetting library for math and chemistry.  AnkiDroid supports Mathjax cards out of the box.  Mathjax is configured to expect TeX formatting, with <code>\(</code> and <code>\)</code> delimiting inline equations and <code>\[</code> and <code>]</code> for display equations.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To try it out, enter the following into a field:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8230;
\(\sqrt{x})
&#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and preview the card.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For more details, see <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/math?id=mathjax">Mathjax Support</a> in the Anki Manual.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ar7lxd/how_to_load_mathjax_color_extension_on_anki/egm6u5j/">Previous workarounds</a> are no longer necessary as of AnkiDroid 2.9.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="reverseCards">Reverse Cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Anki system has <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/getting-started?id=note-types">built-in note types which allow you to review cards in both directions</a>.
When <a href="#addingNotes">creating new material</a> in AnkiDroid, you should choose one of these note types, such as "Basic (and reversed card)",
which will automatically generate a reverse card for you.</p></div>
<img src="img/ReverseNoteType.png">
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you used the wrong note type when adding your material, you can change the note type via the <a href="#editingNotes">edit note screen</a>,
or you can change the note type for multiple cards at once using the browser in Anki Desktop.
To do this, follow the instructions in the <a href="#AnkiDesktop">syncing with Anki Desktop section</a>, then in Anki Desktop open the browser,
select the cards you want to change, then choose <strong>Change note type</strong> from the menu.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Alternatively, if your cards are using a custom card layout which doesn&#8217;t include a reverse card, you can edit the note type to include a reverse card by following the instructions in the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/templates/generation?id=reverse-cards">reverse cards section</a> of the Anki Desktop user manual. While less convenient than using Anki Desktop, it is possible to edit the note type from directly within AnkiDroid as well; see the <a href="#customizingCardLayout">custom card layout section</a> for more on this.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="customFonts">Custom Fonts</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>AnkiDroid allows you to use non-system fonts on your cards. To set them up properly,
it is strongly recommended to use the official method that is used by Anki Desktop. Please see
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/templates/styling?id=installing-fonts">the corresponding section in the desktop
manual</a> for more information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Alternatively, you can create a new subfolder "fonts" in the main AnkiDroid directory (i.e. the folder which contains the "backups" subfolder, specified under Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; AnkiDroid directory), copy a compatible font file (i.e. .ttf) there,
and then set this as the default font under Settings &gt; Fonts &gt; Default font.
Note: this method will change the default font for <strong>all</strong> of your cards, whereas the official method can be more specific. Also, if you sync with AnkiWeb, using this method will lead to cards being displayed differently on different devices.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Only fonts in the ttf format are officially supported in Anki/AnkiDroid;
the <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/#/">Google Noto</a> font set is highly recommended for all languages,
and some other free fonts can be found <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Freely-distributable-fonts">here</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please note that AnkiDroid has to load the entire font into memory in order
to use it, and fonts for Asian languages can be quite large. If you have an
older device and notice AnkiDroid crashing frequently after installing a
font, you may have exceeded your device&#8217;s memory limits. For Google Noto,
it&#8217;s not recommended to use the combined CJK font, rather get the individual languages <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-cjk">separately from here</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Note 1</strong>: If you have "Fetch media on sync" disabled, you may need to manually copy the font file from Anki Desktop to your AnkiDroid/collection.media folder.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Note 2</strong>: If you can&#8217;t get your font to work after following the steps in here and the Anki Desktop manual, please refer to the FAQ for <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/FAQ#i-followed-the-instructions-in-the-manual-but-i-still-cant-get-my-custom-font-to-work">detailed steps on how to debug font issues</a>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="customizingCardLayout">Custom Card Layout</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The layout of flashcards is completely customizable, although this is an advanced topic with a fairly steep learning curve, and you will probably find it a lot more convenient to do the customization with <a href="#AnkiDesktop">Anki Desktop</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/templates/intro?id=card-templates">card templates section</a> of the Anki Desktop manual has detailed instructions on how to edit note types, and most of the actions discussed there are also available from AnkiDroid by tapping "cards" at the bottom of the note editor, or choosing the "manage note types" option in the deck picker. Since detailed information on customizing card layouts is available in the Anki desktop manual, it will not be repeated here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Advanced-formatting">advanced formatting page</a> on the AnkiDroid wiki with various hints on how you can get the most out of your card formatting, and we encourage you to read it, and edit it freely if you have any tips that you&#8217;d like to share with the community.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="typeInAnswer">Type in the answer feature</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>AnkiDroid allows you to type in the correct answer and then compare it to the right answer. You have to set this up with Anki desktop,
as described in the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/templates/fields?id=checking-your-answer">Anki Desktop manual</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>the front of a card with an input box in the card. On AnkiDroid it is replaced with a “&#8230;&#8230;” prompt instead, and a text
input box is shown at the bottom. The comparison between typed text and
the correct text is shown on the answer side in place of the</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The text input box and the soft keyboard can be hidden by ticking
“Disable typing in answer” in the preferences.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Even with typing disabled, the correct answer is shown on the answer
side. This is done on purpose; otherwise the correct answer might not
be shown at all.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To hide the comparison (e.g. because the correct answer is shown anyway), the HTML id
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net//templates/styling?id=card-styling">card styling</a> using Anki Desktop.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The type answer prompt and the comparison have more classes that
can be used to change the way they are displayed. Some of these are
the same as on Anki Desktop, some are specific to AnkiDroid.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The comparison uses three classes, typeGood, typeBad and typeMissing
to add green, red and gray background to the typing comparison. These
three classes are used on Anki desktop as well.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The “&#8230;&#8230;” prompt has the class “typePrompt”.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When typing is set to off in the preferences, the class “typeOff” is
added to the prompt on the question side, and to the div element
containing the comparison on the answer side. This class can be used
to show the type prompt or to hide the typing comparison in
this case.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="advancedStatistics">Advanced Statistics</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If Advanced Statistics are enabled, it changes the <em>Forecast</em> graph so that it shows the estimated number of reviews that will be due on a given day in the future taking into account future reviews, learning new cards and failing cards. The bars and the left axis show the number of cards due on each day if you study all cards each day, while the line and the right axis show the number of unseen (shown as <em>learn</em>), young and mature cards your deck or collection will consist of if you study all cards each day. The forecast graph does count reviews that are currently overdue. It assumes that the overdue cards will be reviewed according to the <em>maximum reviews/day</em> deck option.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Advanced Statistics can be enabled in Settings &#8594; Advanced &#8594; Advanced Statistics (in plugin section).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The outcome of future reviewing, learning or failing cards affects reviews after that future review. To take this into account, the probability of each outcome is computed from the review log. Then the outcome is randomly chosen, such that an outcome which is more likely according to the review log is more likely to be chosen than an outcome which is less likely according to the review log. The settings all affect how the effect of the outcome of future reviews on subsequent reviews is taken into account.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Compute first n days, simulate remainder 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If this setting is set to a number greater than 0, instead of randomly choosing an outcome, each possible outcome is taken into account in the simulation, together with its probability. The probability is taken into account for the graph and for future reviews in which it results, which also affect the graph.
One review has a couple of possible outcomes (say 4), which all result in a review. That review also has a couple of possible outcomes and so on. If many reviews are simulated this way, many reviews (4 x 4 x 4 x &#8230; ) have to be taken into account which increases the time it takes to compose the graph.
Therefore, for reviews later than n days from now are simulated by randomly choosing an outcome.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>+
In summary, higher n gives a more accurate graph, but it takes more time to compose the graph.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Precision of computation 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Reviews which occur with a probability smaller than 100% minus the configured precision of the computation are simulated by randomly choosing an outcome rather than taking into account each possible outcome. This setting is only applicable if the first n days are computed.
If Advanced Statistics are disabled, the <em>Forecast</em> graph shows the estimated number of reviews that will be due on a given day in the future if you do not review cards, learn no new cards and fail no cards.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>+
In summary, higher precision gives a more accurate graph, but it takes more time to compose the graph.</p></div>

Number of iterations of  the simulation

<p>
Composes the graph several times and then displays the average of these graphs.
Each time the graph is composed, another outcome might be randomly chosen.  If we average many outcomes which are randomly chosen taking into account the probabilities from the review log, the average outcome will likely be close to the average of the probabilities from the review log.
If we average many graphs, the average graph will likely be close to the graph which is generated by taking into account all possible outcomes.
If the number of graphs which are averaged is not too high, it will be faster than taking into account all possible outcomes.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>+
In summary, a higher number of iterations gives a more accurate graph, but it takes more time to compose the graph.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="reminders">Reminders</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>AnkiDroid can remind you to devote some time to reviewing cards every day at a specific time via Android&#8217;s notification framework.
You can configure reminders for each options group independently.
To configure a notification go to Deck options &gt; Reminders, then tick the checkbox and select the time you want to be notified at.
To stop receiving notifications go to Deck options &gt; Reminders and unmark the checkbox.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Notifications only work for top level decks. Please let us know if you want us to add notifications for subdecks too.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="setlanguagehint">Automatic Language Selection</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>AnkiDroid has an in Automatic Language Selection feature in the Note Editor starting with AnkiDroid 2.13. This feature allows you to define a default language to be used in your keyboard for a field in a note type.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, if you have Russian and English note fields, and your keyboard supports the setImeHintLocales Android API, the keyboard layout will switch to Russian in the first field and back to English in the second automatically when the fields get focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/JrxDjTrRhBE">Checkout video reference for demonstration</a></p></div>
