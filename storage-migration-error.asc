= Unexpected error during Storage Migration
:sectanchors:

There was an error copying your media to a folder supported by Android R. Before the process started, your data was backed up to AnkiWeb and can be restored.

Before continuing, please:

1. Take a backup of your collection (including scheduling + media) via Deck Picker -> Export collection
  * See <<take_manual_backup,'Manual Backups'>> if you desire a file-based backup
2. Report the error to us: https://docs.ankidroid.org/help.html#_support

=== Restoring from AnkiWeb Backup

If you have reviewed a significant number of cards using AnkiDroid since the migration started, see: <<restore_modified_collection,Restoring a Modified Collection>>

* Reinstall AnkiDroid
** Do not keep app data on uninstall. (*Ensure you have backed up, this will delete the AnkiDroid collection, media and backups from the AnkiDroid folder*)
* Open AnkiDroid, select "Sync from AnkiWeb", 
** Log in and re-sync your collection
** Syncing will be significantly faster than AnkiDroid 2.15
* Once you are synced, you may delete the folder collection in `/storage/emulated/0/AnkiDroid` to save space. 
* Your collection is now located at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.ichi2.anki/files`

=== Restoring a Modified Collection [[restore_modified_collection]]

*Ensure that you have backed up your collection and media*

* Uninstall AnkiDroid
** Do not keep app data. (**This will delete the AnkiDroid collection, media and backups**)
* Reinstall AnkiDroid
* Select 'Get Statred'
* Select 'Deck Picker -> Import'
* Import the backup which was created
* Open a file browser and browse to `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.ichi2.anki/files`
* Delete the `collection.media` folder and file: `collection.media.ad.db2`. Delete `collection.media.ad.db2-journal` if it exists.
* Sync with AnkiWeb and your missing media will be downloaded

=== Manual Backups [[take_manual_backup]]

* Your migrated data exists at the folder listed in _Settings -> Advanced -> AnkiDroid directory_. This is typically: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.ichi2.anki/files` 
** If you installed a parallel build, replace `com.ichi2.anki` with `com.ichi2.anki.A`
** Some file managers will be unable to access this folder. You should be able to access this folder via USB.
** Android will offer to delete this folder when AnkiDroid is uninstalled
* Your non-migrated media and backups of your collection exist at `/storage/emulated/0/AnkiDroid`
