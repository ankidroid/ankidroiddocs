# MathJax Support
Mathjax is a modern typesetting library for math and chemistry.  AnkiDroid supports Mathjax cards out of the box.  Mathjax is configured to expect TeX formatting, with `\(` and `\)` delimiting inline equations and `\[` and `\]` for display equations.

To try it out, enter the following into a field:

```
\(\sqrt{x}\)
```

and preview the card.

For more details, see [Mathjax Support](https://docs.ankiweb.net/math.html#mathjax) in the Anki Manual.

[Previous workarounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ar7lxd/how_to_load_mathjax_color_extension_on_anki/egm6u5j) are no longer necessary as of AnkiDroid 2.9.
