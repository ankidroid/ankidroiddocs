# Note Formatting Toolbar

The note formatting toolbar contains basic text formatting buttons (Bold, Italic, Underline, Horizontal Line, Insert Title, Change Font Size, [Insert MathJax](advanced-features/mathjax.md) and Insert Cloze Deletion).

It also allows the addition of user-defined toolbar buttons using HTML. HTML is a powerful language allowing nearly endless customization of your cards. [Our wiki](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Note-Editor-Toolbar-HTML-Samples) contains common code samples to get you started.

A user-defined toolbar button can be removed by long pressing the button and selecting **Delete**.
