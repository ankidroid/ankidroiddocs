# Contributing to AnkiDroid

<!-- toc -->

AnkiDroid is an open source project, and its development relies on contributions from volunteers. Here are some of the ways you can contribute to the AnkiDroid project:

### Get involved
Rate the app, join the [AnkiDroid forum](https://groups.google.com/g/anki-android) and answer questions for other users, submit bug reports, become a [beta tester](beta-testing.md), etc. More detailed information on ways you can contribute as a non-developer can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Contributing).

### Translate
Translations of AnkiDroid and this user manual are all contributed by users, and are greatly appreciated. 
See the <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Contributing#translate-ankidroid">translating</a> wiki page for detailed instructions on how to contribute translations.

### Develop
The source code for AnkiDroid is available on our main [Github page](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android), and bug fixes as well as new features are very welcome. 
Before investing a lot of time on working on a new feature, you may like to ask on the forum first if it's likely to be merged into the main project, as not all features will be accepted.
If you are just getting started with Android programming, feel free to ask on the forum for some tips and/or tasks which are suitable for beginners.
