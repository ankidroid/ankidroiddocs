# Automatic Language Selection
AnkiDroid has an in Automatic Language Selection feature in the Note Editor starting with AnkiDroid 2.13. This feature allows you to define a default language to be used in your keyboard for a field in a note type.


For example, if you have Russian and English note fields, and your keyboard supports the setImeHintLocales Android API, the keyboard layout will switch to Russian in the first field and back to English in the second automatically when the fields get focus.
