# Custom Card Layout
The layout of flashcards is completely customizable, although this is an advanced topic with a fairly steep learning curve, and you will probably find it a lot more convenient to do the customization with [Anki Desktop](../anki-desktop.md). 

The [card templates section](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/intro.html) of the Anki Desktop manual has detailed instructions on how to edit note types, and most of the actions discussed there are also available from AnkiDroid by tapping **cards** at the bottom of the note editor, or choosing the **manage note types** option in the deck picker. Since detailed information on customizing card layouts is available in the Anki desktop manual, it will not be repeated here.

There is an [advanced formatting page](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Advanced-formatting) on the AnkiDroid wiki with various hints on how you can get the most out of your card formatting, and we encourage you to read it, and edit it freely if you have any tips that you'd like to share with the community.
