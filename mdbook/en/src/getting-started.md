# Getting started
To start using AnkiDroid, we need to add some cards to study. From the main screen, tapping the big blue plus button will allow you to either add a new **note** (i.e. create new flashcards), download shared decks (decks that other people have created and shared online), or create new empty decks.

Please watch this 5 minute [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2K1gOSdIZA), which gives an introduction to adding, downloading, and studying cards in AnkiDroid. More detailed information can be found in the sections below.

If you are an existing user of Anki Desktop wishing to import your decks from the computer, you might like to skip straight to the [using AnkiDroid with Anki Desktop](anki-desktop.md#using-anki-desktop-with-ankidroid) section.
