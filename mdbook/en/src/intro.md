# Introduction

Thank you for using AnkiDroid, the Android client for the popular [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) spaced repetition system. 

Anki is spaced repetition technique which is simple but highly effective. It helps you memorize things by automatically repeating them across increasing intervals based on your responses with no need for you to keep track of what to study or when to study it. You create notes (or download shared decks) with content you need to memorize, and the scheduler will make sure you see the content when you need to.

AnkiDroid is intended to be used in conjunction with Anki on your computer. While it is possible to function without it, some tasks are either only possible with, or a lot more efficient with Anki Desktop. Furthermore, it is **strongly recommended** to at least read [`Key Concepts`](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#key-concepts) section of the main Anki manual to understand the terminology used here.

If this manual doesn't contain what you are looking for, please check the [AnkiDroid Wiki](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki) for a list of changes, instructions for submitting bug reports and feature requests, a list of frequently asked questions, and much more.
