# Filtered Decks

Anki is designed to optimize the learning process, so that you study the minimum amount necessary to remember the majority of your cards. Once the congratulations screen is reached, further study becomes a case of diminishing returns: the amount of extra time spent going over the same cards again is generally not worth the moderate increase in retention you'll see.

That said, if you have a test looming, or simply want to pass some time, it's possible to keep reviewing even after you are shown the congratulations message.

A **filtered deck** is a temporary deck that contains cards based on various criteria, such as **forgotten today**, `is tagged 'hard'`, and so on. After studying cards in a filtered deck, or when the filtered deck is deleted, the cards are automatically returned to their original deck.

The easiest way to create a filtered deck is by long clicking on a deck and choosing the **custom study** option. 

Advanced users can create a filtered deck manually, by choosing **Create filtered deck** from the overflow menu in the deck list screen.

For further information on filtered decks, please see the [desktop documentation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/filtered-decks.html#filtered-decks--cramming).
