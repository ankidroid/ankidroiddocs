# Reminders
AnkiDroid can remind you to devote some time to reviewing cards every day at a specific time via Android's notification framework.
You can configure reminders for each options group independently.
To configure a notification go to Deck options > Reminders, then tick the checkbox and select the time you want to be notified at.
To stop receiving notifications go to Deck options > Reminders and unmark the checkbox.

Notifications only work for top level decks. Please let us know if you want us to add notifications for subdecks too.
