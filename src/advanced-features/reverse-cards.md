# Reverse Cards

The Anki system has [built-in note types which allow you to review cards in both directions](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types). 
When [creating new material](../adding-notes.md) in AnkiDroid, you should choose one of these note types, such as **Basic (and reversed card)**, which will automatically generate a reverse card for you.

If you used the wrong note type when adding your material, you can change the note type via the [edit note screen](../editing-notes.md), or you can change the note type for multiple cards at once using the browser in Anki Desktop. 
To do this, follow the instructions in the [syncing with Anki Desktop section](../anki-desktop.md), then in Anki Desktop open the browser, select the cards you want to change, then choose **Change note type** from the menu.

Alternatively, if your cards are using a custom card layout which doesn't include a reverse card, you can edit the note type to include a reverse card by following the instructions in the [reverse cards section](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/generation.html#reverse-cards) of the Anki Desktop user manual. While less convenient than using Anki Desktop, it is possible to edit the note type from directly within AnkiDroid as well; see the [custom card layout section](../advanced-features/customizing-card-layout.md) for more on this.
