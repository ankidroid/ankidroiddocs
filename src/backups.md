# Automatic Backups

AnkiDroid will automatically create backups of your collection for you. The backups include all your cards and statistics, but do not include sounds or images.

The backup is taken in the background when you first start the app. A backup will only happen if more than 5 hours has elapsed since the last time a backup was created.
By default, AnkiDroid will store the last 8 backups; this number can be changed in the main settings.

You can restore a backup by choosing the _restore from backup_ option from the main menu of the [decks screen](deck-picker.md).
