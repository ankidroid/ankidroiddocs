# Beta testing
If you want to try out the latest features in AnkiDroid, you can sign up for the beta testing program as follows:

 1. Visit the [Google Play Beta page](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.ichi2.anki)
 2. Click **Become a beta tester**
 
After following these steps, the latest beta version will automatically be installed by Google Play in the same way as ordinary updates.

If you are more adventurous, you can also become an alpha tester, by joining the [alpha testers group](https://groups.google.com/g/ankidroidalphatesters) in addition to performing the above steps for beta testing.

Please submit any bugs you find in these development versions to the AnkiDroid issue tracker, as per the link:help.html[main help page].

If you wish to leave the testing program at any time, simply visit the [Google Play Beta page](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.ichi2.anki) and click **Leave the test**.
