# Exporting Anki Files

AnkiDroid can export your flashcards in the .apkg Anki file format so that you can import them into Anki Desktop, or share them with other people. 
As in Anki Desktop, you can either export a [collection package or deck package](https://docs.ankiweb.net/exporting.html#packaged-decks), depending on what you are trying to achieve.

There are two export options available: **include scheduling information** and **include media**. Generally the default options are sufficient, if you choose not to include scheduling information, Anki will assume that you are sharing the deck with other people, and will remove marked and leech tags so that they will have a clean copy of it.

## Exporting collection package
When exporting for use in Anki Desktop, you generally want to [export your entire collection](https://docs.ankiweb.net/exporting.html#collection-colpkg), including all your review history etc. 

From the main menu in the decks screen:

 1. Tap the **Export** item in the menu.
 2. Tap **OK** using default options
 3. Tap **OK** again to email the exported collection.apkg file to yourself, or alternatively you can manually copy to your computer using USB
 
To import the file on your computer:

 1. Save the file **collection.apkg** to your desktop
 2. Double-click on the file to start Anki.
 3. Confirm you wish to replace, so that the deck from your mobile device
   overwrites the old data on your desktop.
 4. After importing, you can delete the apkg file on your desktop if you wish.
 
## Exporting deck package
If you want to share a deck in AnkiDroid with another user, you can export a deck package. 

From the main menu in the decks screen:

 1. Long tap on the deck you wish to export
 2. Tap **Export**
 3. Tap **OK** using the default options
 4. Tap **OK** again to email the exported apkg to another user
