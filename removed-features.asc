== Automatic night mode color inversion

NOTE: Removed in AnkiDroid 2.17

=== Feature Description

Previously, AnkiDroid contained a very basic color inverter for card content in night mode. For example it changed white to black and black to white. It inverted *all* colors though for example green inverts to pink. These changes were frequently unwanted.

=== Reason for removal

This feature was introduced in 2012, before either Android or Anki had night mode functionality.

AnkiDroid implemented Android's 'follow system' night mode functionality in 2.16, which made the functionality more
prominent.

In 2.17, AnkiDroid was updated to use unified night mode card rendering code across the Anki ecosystem.
As color inversion was an unexpected feature for our users, and did not match Anki Desktop's behavior, it was removed.

=== Action to take

If you are impacted by these changes, you may link:manual.html#customizingCardLayout[customize the CSS] of
your card templates using the `night_mode` selector. The css: `filter: invert(1)`

[source,css]
----
.card {
  --text-color1: black;
}

.card.night_mode {
  --text-color1: white;
}

.title {
   color: var(--text-color1);
}

/* filter could also be used */

.title {
    color: red;
}

.night_mode .title {
	filter: invert(100%);
}

== Custom Fonts in `/fonts`

NOTE: Removed in AnkiDroid 2.17

=== Feature Description

Alternatively, you can create a new subfolder "fonts" in the main AnkiDroid directory (i.e. the folder which contains the "backups" subfolder, specified under Settings > Advanced > AnkiDroid directory), copy a compatible font file (i.e. .ttf) there,
and then set this as the default font under Settings > Fonts > Default font.
Note: this method will change the default font for *all* of your cards, whereas the official method can be more specific. Also, if you sync with AnkiWeb, using this method will lead to cards being displayed differently on different devices.

Only fonts in the ttf format are officially supported in Anki/AnkiDroid;
the https://www.google.com/get/noto/#/[Google Noto] font set is highly recommended for all languages,
and some other free fonts can be found https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Freely-distributable-fonts[here].

=== Reason for Removal

Custom fonts were not synced. The default fonts which we supplied did not work on Samsung phones, and access to the
`fonts` folder was made more difficult due to AnkiDroid being moved to the app private folder.

For reviewing, using fonts in `collection.media` is better as it syncs across the ecosystem. App fonts were not heavily used.

https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/14343

=== Action to take

For the reviewer: Move the fonts to `collection.media` and update card templates if necessary.
The file names should be prefixed with a `_` so they are not affected by 'check media'.

See link:manual.html#customFonts[Manual: Custom Fonts] for more information

For other text in the app: Custom fonts are no longer supported and the default fonts by the OS will be used

== Gesture Action: Answer better than recommended

NOTE: Removed in AnkiDroid 2.17

=== Feature Description

When the answer screen is shown, choose the button on the right, indicating you found the card too easy to remember and would like a much longer delay.

=== Reason for Removal

Previous versions of the Anki Scheduler had a variable number of buttons. The V3 scheduler always has 4 buttons, so this option no longer has unique functionality.

=== Action to take

The functionality is now equivalent to 'Answer easy', either reassign the action, or remove it.

== Gesture Action: Answer recommended (green)

NOTE: Removed in AnkiDroid 2.17

=== Feature Description

When the answer screen is shown, choose the green button.
This is the button you should end up using the most.

Previous versions of the Anki Scheduler had a variable number of buttons. The V3 scheduler always has 4 buttons, so this option no longer has unique functionality.

=== Action to take

The functionality is now equivalent to 'Answer good', either reassign the action, or remove it.
